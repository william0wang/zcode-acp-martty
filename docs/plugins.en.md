# Plugin API

Third parties extend the TUI only through the APIs on this page. Objects, fds, and methods not listed here are not provided. Make them unreachable in the host; do not document a honor-system ban.

**Open now:** palette packs, the root `chrome.right` rail,
`conversation.input.dock` above the composer,
`conversation.navigation.dock` between the input and composer metadata, the outer
`conversation.composer.dock` telemetry row, local commands and semantic overlays,
plus standard ACP Session config, Plan, statistics, and run-state facts. All four slots
are additive list seats. They accept structured `TuiNode` trees and never become
session history.

## Open: `acpSessionPlan`

`acpSessionPlan` folds standard ACP `session/update` `plan`, `plan_update`, and
`plan_removed` messages into structured state with `list()`, `current()`, and
`subscribe(listener)`. The builtin `plan-view` Client Plugin consumes it like any
other plugin: it owns the `conversation.input.dock` summary and registers local
`/plan-view` to open the full list with `tuiOverlay.openView()`. The active entry uses
a distinct `◐` marker in the review and the animated running marker in the dock, and is
explicitly labeled `in progress` in both surfaces. Agent `/plan`
command or mode semantics remain separate.

## Open: `acpSessionStats`

`acpSessionStats` folds standard ACP prompt-response usage, first text/thought
tokens, tool calls, and resumed usage into current-session token, cache, turn,
step, LLM, tool, TTFT, and throughput statistics. It exposes `current()` and
`subscribe(listener)`. The builtin `stats-view` Client Plugin is merely its
default consumer: it contributes the compact readout to
`conversation.composer.dock`; the Rust shell no longer owns that business UI.

Each segment of the stats line is configurable through the `DSH_TUI_STATS`
environment variable: a comma-separated list of segment ids — `tokens`
(`↑in · ↓out`), `context` (context-window gauge), `counts` (turns/steps),
`cache` (hit rate), `time` (LLM/tool time), `speed` (TTFT/tok/s). The list
decides both membership and order (`context,tokens` puts the gauge first);
unset or `all` shows every segment (the default), `none`/`off`/empty hides
them all, and unknown ids are dropped silently. Example:
`DSH_TUI_STATS=tokens,context martty` keeps just the token and gauge segments.

## Open: `acpSessionStatus`

`acpSessionStatus` folds the non-statistics facts `/status` needs from standard
ACP initialize / authenticate / session / `session/prompt` response /
`session/update` traffic, plus the optional Martty `session.status` /
`session.event` extensions: state (idle/starting/running), connection, server,
authenticate state, session binding, model, effort, permission, plan, and agent
preset. It exposes `current()` and `subscribe(listener)` and never accumulates
tokens or timings — statistics have exactly one source, `acpSessionStats`.

The builtin `status-view` Client Plugin is its default consumer: it registers
the local `/status` command and opens a markdown status view with
`tuiOverlay.openView()`. Run-state facts come from
`acpSessionStatus.current()`; tokens, turns, steps, LLM/tool time, TTFT, and
rate all come from `acpSessionStats.current()` — the same snapshot `stats-view`
renders in the composer dock, so the two readouts cannot drift. The Rust
painter only renders the serialized `TuiNode`s and reads none of its own
transcript accumulators for this command. Runs without a Client tree (demo,
standalone painter) keep a lean Rust fallback that renders run-state and ACP
facts only, also without touching token/timing accumulators.

## Builtin Queue and Agent projections

Queue and Agent/session state are local Client interaction state, not timeline
content and not public domain services. The Rust painter sends snapshots to the
builtin `tuiQueue` and `tuiAgents` services. `queue-view` contributes the Queue
summary and every queued item to `conversation.input.dock`; `agents-view` contributes the
compact session rail to `conversation.navigation.dock` and registers `/agents`.
The normal Queue title keeps `enter send first` visible. With an empty composer,
Enter steers the FIFO head into the active turn; a deferred steer returns to the front.
The default rail is a muted `· Agents · completed/total` summary. `↓` expands main and
every subagent in place; `←/→` moves, Enter opens, and Escape collapses.
No overlay or mouse action is created.
Native views remain as no-Client-tree fallbacks.

Agent navigation adds no business-specific color tokens. Optional
`generic.tone` values reference the existing general Theme tokens. The collapsed
label uses `caption`; running progress alternates between `brand_soft` and `brand`,
failure uses `err`, and the remaining text and chrome use `fg`, `panel`, and
`border`. Plan summaries use the same visual grammar.

## UI Plugins and the two welcome slots

`tuiPresets` composes several independent UI Plugin contributions into one
saved choice. It lives on the Client tree, separate from Agent Presets that
compose Host/Agent capabilities, and is not an alias for Theme. The `mount`
callback passed to `ctx.tuiPresets.register({ id, label }, mount)` composes only
structural UI contributions such as slots, chrome, or a pet and returns one
disposer. It does not register, select, or generate a Theme: `/ui`, `/theme`,
and dark/light are independent state dimensions. `/ui`
opens the native single-select form, `/ui ` reuses the slash menu above the
composer for candidates, and `/ui <id>` switches directly. The id persists in
`$MARTTY_HOME/settings.json`. Creator can inspect `UiPresets` and adjacent Client
services, generate a `code.client` Package that calls `tuiPresets.register`,
and preview it with `cordis_define/run`. Those operations are process-local;
after a successful run, `tui_plugin_save` must write it under
`$MARTTY_HOME/plugins/<artifact-id>/plugin.json` for restart recovery.
New artifacts use `kind: "ui"`. Legacy `kind: "ui-preset"` manifests normalize
to `ui` when read; `UiPresets`, `tuiPresets`, and the `uiPreset` settings key
remain compatibility-only internal names.

The builtin `default` (Martty) and `deepseek` UI Plugins both fill two single
root slots:

- `welcome.hero`: the centered brand region, structured as `logo + hint`;
- `welcome.info`: the lower-left version, model, workspace, session,
  credential, access, and help region.

Both currently reuse the native dynamic information renderer, but that region
is independently replaceable. `deepseek-logo` only registers the `deepseek`
preset; it owns no special slash command. Use `/ui deepseek` and `/ui default`.
The Rust painter keeps the original responsive whale/wordmark primitive and
owns centering and balanced outer padding. Switching never enters the ACP
prompt or transcript.

## Open: `tuiTheme`

`palette` must match [tui-palette.v0.schema.json](tui-palette.v0.schema.json).

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable string; colliding with an existing id fails `register` |
| `label` | Short name for `/theme` |
| `dark` / `light` | Each is a **complete** token → `#RRGGBB` map. Missing any token, or any unknown name, fails |

Closed token names:

`bg` `surface` `panel` `fg` `fg_secondary` `fg_tertiary` `caption` `brand` `brand_soft` `bubble_bg` `bubble_fg` `border` `code_bg` `ok` `warn` `err` `hint` `chip_bg`

Builtin `default` remains the cold bluish skin and cannot be replaced or removed.
`/theme toggle` and `ctrl+t` only change dark/light inside the current theme.
The `/theme ` completion menu separates toggle from Theme Plugins. `/theme <id>` is a special
**single-select Theme Plugin switch**: selecting an id starts its owning Client
Plugin and stops the previously selected Theme Plugin; selecting `default` stops
the current dynamic Theme Plugin. Explicit selection persists beside
`uiPreset` in `$MARTTY_HOME/settings.json`; temporary Creator previews and automatic
fallbacks do not rewrite that preference.

A Theme Plugin may register a palette, commands, overlays, slots, timers,
transactions, and Package-private RPC together. None uses a theme condition or
subscribes to the active theme; they are ordinary contributions of one Cordis
Fiber. `/theme` replacement, stop, update, or unload retracts that whole Fiber.
Stopped Theme Plugin ids remain in the `/theme` catalog so they can be started
again later.

`register(palette, { activate: true })` is the immediate-preview path for a new
dynamic `cordis_run`. The Client runner places that run in the same `/theme` seat
and replaces the previous Theme Plugin; if the target fails, the previous Plugin
stays intact. The dynamic Client facade exposes `register` only, not `activate()`,
`active()`, or theme `subscribe()`, so code cannot bypass the Plugin switch.

This changes the TUI: composer, status, borders, bubbles, code blocks, tool cards, and the hint row all recolor. Layout, box-drawing characters, font size, and kitty pet sprites do not.

A Theme Plugin remains an ordinary Cordis Plugin: one `apply` registers independent
contributions through their services and one Fiber owns all disposers. `/theme`
only provides special single-select switching between those Plugins.

Cordis mode discovers this API through Client inspect: `Theme` on platform
`client` is the directory published by the TUI over ACP, not `tuiTheme` on the
Agent tree. `code.client` injects `tuiTheme` and registers its palette; the same
Plugin injects other services for its other contributions. Do not use Web
`theme.overrideTokens`, CSS variables, or theme conditions.

## Minimal plugin

```js
export const inject = ["tuiTheme"];

export function apply(ctx) {
  ctx.effect(() => ctx.tuiTheme.register({
    id: "ember",
    label: "Ember",
    dark: { /* 18 tokens, see fixtures/demo-skin.v0.json */ },
    light: { /* 18 tokens */ },
  }));
}
```

For immediate preview, change the registration call to:

```js
ctx.tuiTheme.register(palette, { activate: true })
```

Do not subscribe to theme state or hand-write a return path; `/theme` replaces the
whole Plugin.

## Open: `tuiSlots`

The shell declares four additive list slots: the root `chrome.right` rail,
`conversation.input.dock` above the composer,
`conversation.navigation.dock` inside the composer above its metadata row, and the
outer compact `conversation.composer.dock` telemetry row. A plugin waits with
`inject`, then `register`s any composition of the node kinds in
[tui-node.v0.schema.json](tui-node.v0.schema.json).

```js
export const inject = ['tuiSlots']
export function apply(ctx) {
  ctx.tuiSlots.inject('chrome.right', () => {
    const panel = ctx.tuiSlots.register(
      { name: 'chrome.right', id: 'build-monitor', order: 20 },
      [{ id: 'title', kind: 'markdown', text: '# Build monitor' }],
    )
    return panel.dispose
  })
}
```

`panel.update(nextNodes)` replaces the contribution immediately. Unload removes
it; the rail collapses when the last contribution disappears. Narrow terminals
temporarily hide the rail without deleting state. Dynamic Creator plugins query
`Slots.list` and inject `tuiSlots`, not Web React `ctx.slots`. The optional
`@openma/deepseek-harness-tui/right-demo` export is a rich gallery plugin.

Use the same registration API for all three conversation docks. Put Plan, Todo, Goal, or
other content needing its own line in `conversation.input.dock` — it owns the
single cap row and displaces the tip line while present; put ambient compact
navigation such as Agents, branches, or sessions in
`conversation.navigation.dock`; put ambient compact statistics in
`conversation.composer.dock`. Open detailed content in a command-owned overlay
instead of expanding the compact stats seat. A generic node's optional `tone`
references an existing general Theme token; it cannot add a token and should not
invent business-specific color semantics. Use the general boolean
`selected: true` for transient keyboard focus; the painter renders it reversed.
It is not a persistent value or another status color.

## Open: `tuiOverlay`

`openSlider(options, handlers)` opens a numeric slider;
`openSelect(options, handlers)` opens an ordinary single-select form; and
`openView({ id, title, nodes })` opens a read-only `TuiNode[]` modal. All three
share one modal seat and return a lifecycle-owned `close()` controller. Views scroll
with up/down and close through Enter or Escape; the primitive has no Plan-specific
behavior.

Select options may carry `group?: string`, a single-line decorative heading and
divider, never a navigable or submitted option. Calling `openSelect` with the same
id refreshes options and handlers without closing the modal. The painter preserves
the search query and selected value when still visible; an old controller cannot
close the refreshed panel.

Select options may opt into `deletable?: boolean` with `handlers.onDelete(value)`.
Delete closes the form and dispatches a separate `delete` event, not a submit.
Disabled or non-deletable rows and absent handlers do nothing. Non-searchable forms
also accept Backspace (Mac Delete); searchable forms keep Backspace for editing.
The owning plugin presents confirmation and performs any deletion.

Local commands may declare
`input: { hint, options: [{ value, label, description }] }` in
`tuiCommands.register`. After `/name `, the Rust painter reuses the existing
upward slash menu for those candidates. The returned disposer also exposes
`update({ input })` so dynamic catalogs such as UI Plugins can refresh them.
Standard ACP `AvailableCommand.input` currently carries only `hint`, not an
enumerated candidate list; Agent commands therefore expose the standard hint,
while Client extensions or values derived from ACP config/catalog can provide
actual candidates.

### Host data and polling

A dynamic Package's Host half registers Package-private JSON methods with
`harness.handle(method, handler)`. Its Client half calls them with
`host.call(method, args)`. Arguments and results must be lossless JSON; omitting
`args` delivers `null` to the Host.

For periodic refresh, also inject `timer` and use the Plugin-owned
`ctx.interval`; never use a bare Node `setInterval`:

```js
return {
  inject: ['tuiSlots', 'timer'],
  apply(ctx) {
    const panel = ctx.tuiSlots.register(
      { name: 'chrome.right', id: 'monitor' },
      [{ id: 'loading', kind: 'notice', level: 'info', text: 'Loading…' }],
    )
    let refreshing = false
    const refresh = async () => {
      if (refreshing) return
      refreshing = true
      try {
        const state = await host.call('read-state')
        panel.update([{ id: 'state', kind: 'generic', title: 'State', body: state.text }])
      } catch (error) {
        panel.update([{ id: 'error', kind: 'notice', level: 'error', text: String(error) }])
      } finally {
        refreshing = false
      }
    }
    void refresh()
    ctx.interval(() => void refresh(), 1000)
  },
}
```

`host.call` uses the negotiated ACP `_dsh/cordis/plugin/invoke` Extension Request. Timers and Slots remain in the
Client tree and never become `session/update` or conversation history.

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: tui-right-demo
      name: '@openma/deepseek-harness-tui/right-demo'
```

## Not provided

Plugin modules do not receive: the TTY, stdin, raw mode, kitty escapes, ratatui, the JSON-RPC method table, fd 3/4, the `_dsh/cordis/tui/*` transport, full-screen rows/cols, a frame loop, or coordinates such as “bottom N rows”.

Nodes must not contain RGB; color only by token name. RGB appears only in a palette pack's `dark`/`light` tables.

## Persistence and loading

TUI merges builtins, installed package entries, and Creator artifacts into the
same `/ui` and `/theme` catalogs. Install a third-party package with
`dsh plugin --profile martty add <package-or-path>`. Its Host registrar registers
an absolute Client module entry with `tuiClientPlugins`; the Host runner sends
only that serialized directory to the separate Client process. Client-only
Creator artifacts live under `$MARTTY_HOME/plugins` and are managed by
`tui_plugin_list/read/save/remove`. Installed packages win same-id conflicts.

`tui_plugin_save` accepts only Packages without `code.host`. Any Host half,
with or without a Client half, makes the complete Plugin Harness-owned and
subject to that Harness's persistence path; Martty never writes Host code into
`.martty`.

`MARTTY_HOME` resolves from the explicit environment variable, then
`$DSH_HOME/.martty`, then `~/.martty`. On first startup, legacy artifacts and
settings are copied forward without deleting the source or overwriting current
Martty data.

An installed package exports a small Host registrar:

```js
export const inject = ['tuiClientPlugins']
export function apply(ctx) {
  return ctx.tuiClientPlugins.register({
    id: 'paper-lantern',
    kind: 'theme',
    entry: new URL('./client.js', import.meta.url).href,
  })
}
```

Its `client.js` exports an ordinary Cordis Client `inject` / `apply` module.
The package bundle patch inserts only the registrar on the Host profile; no
Host fiber, service, or plugin tree is synchronized to the Client.

Cordis has **no** parent pointer from one plugin instance onto another.
`tui-theme`, palette packs, `tui-cordis-client-runner`, and `tui-runner` are
peer lifecycles in the Client tree.

The protocol that waits on the TUI capability is the service name:

1. `tui-theme` and `tui-slots` provide `ctx.tuiTheme` and `ctx.tuiSlots`.
2. `tui-cordis-client-runner` injects both, publishes inspect, and evaluates dynamic `code.client`.
3. Third-party Client modules inject the service they use and stay PENDING until it exists.
4. Package and Creator modules use the same restricted Client facade and lifecycle manager.

Do not stack third parties with `ctx.plugin(ember)` inside the runner. The
composition mounts third-party packages as siblings. Web
Web `ctx.slots` and terminal `ctx.tuiSlots` are different services.

Local packages use `dsh plugin --profile martty add ./path` and load **package
exports**. A new registrar needs a TUI restart or later `/refresh`. Hot-swap of
an already-mounted palette ships by phase.

## Later

Conversation slots such as `conversation.chat` remain closed. ACP `session/update` stays the transcript source of truth.
