## Global Agent TUI

```sh
npm install --global martty
martty
```

Martty directly depends on our `@openma/deepseek-harness-acp` implementation.
It resolves this built-in ACP from its own dependency graph, connects DSH by
default, and requires no separate ACP installation. For another ACP server,
configure `DSH_TUI_AGENT`; Cordis embedding can instead provide `config.agent`
or `config.stream`. `--agent` is only the standalone CLI override for the same
connection configuration.

## Recommended

```sh
npm install --global @deepseek-ai/dsh
dsh plugin --profile martty add martty@latest
dsh --profile martty
```

The profile command is the recommended install and upgrade path. It creates a
missing profile and installs the TUI plus its ACP dependency; no global
`martty` installation is required.

## Migrating from DeepSeek Harness TUI / the scoped package

`martty` is the recommended package name. Starting with `0.2.13`, it and the
legacy `@openma/deepseek-harness-tui` package are published by the same CI run
with identical versions and artifacts. Existing scoped-package installs remain
supported. To switch package names:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile tui remove @openma/deepseek-harness-tui
dsh plugin --profile martty add martty@latest
```

The recommended profile changes from `tui` to `martty`; runtime behavior,
config, and session data remain unchanged. `dsh-tui` and legacy `tui`
profiles remain compatible.

The profile Host mounts the ACP plugin on Base, then starts a separate TUI
Client process over standard ACP stdin/stdout. For standalone use, run
`martty` and use `--agent <cmd>` plus repeated `--agent-arg <arg>` for another
ACP server.

### Harness CLI quick start

Run these commands in a system terminal. Browse first and replace `<id>` with the ID printed
by `find`, not the display name. The angle brackets are placeholders, not literal shell input.

```sh
martty harness find         # Browse Registry and local candidates
martty harness add <id>     # Install/save configuration
martty harness use <id>     # Set the next-launch default
martty                     # Start the TUI in the current directory
```

`add` and `use` do not switch a running TUI; use `/harness` inside it to switch now.
To inspect, refresh, or remove configuration:

```sh
martty harness list
martty harness find --refresh
martty harness remove <id> --cleanup --dry-run  # Preview only
martty harness remove <id>                     # Confirm configuration-only removal
martty harness remove <id> --cleanup           # Also delete exclusive private binaries
```

In a source checkout where `martty` is not on PATH, run `node npm/bin/martty.js harness --help`
from the repository root and use that entrypoint in place of `martty` in the other commands.
For an unlisted ACP server, use `martty harness add local --command /absolute/path/to/local-acp
--arg --stdio`, replacing the path and arguments with your server's actual ACP invocation.

### Registry and TUI setup

`harness find` reads a cached/bundled snapshot of the official ACP Registry from
`https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json` and supplements it
with local `*-acp` / `*_acp` PATH discovery; it is not an npm package search or an immediate
switch. `npx` / `uvx` entries become launch recipes without implicit `--yes` or
`--prefer-offline` flags. Selecting a binary distribution downloads it into
`$MARTTY_HOME/bin/<id>/<version>/<platform>`, verifies its declared SHA-256, and configures
the resulting executable without modifying the system PATH. The same flow is available in
the TUI with `/harness find`; manual `--command` remains available for unregistered agents.
Use `harness find --refresh` for a network refresh; offline refresh keeps the local catalog.
CLI `add` only installs/saves configuration and reuses saved recipes; `use` sets the next-launch
default without starting/authenticating an agent. `harness remove <id>` previews and confirms
configuration removal; `--cleanup` also removes exclusive private binary resources, `--dry-run`
only previews, and `--yes` confirms in scripts. Global programs, shared caches, history and
credentials are kept. Stop other instances using the target before cleanup. Downloads report
progress to stderr, and Ctrl-C cancels and clears staging without saving incomplete configuration.
Windows uses `%MARTTY_HOME%\bin\<id>\<version>\<platform>` (`windows-x86_64` or `windows-aarch64`) and
resolves package runners through `PATHEXT` (`npx.cmd`, `uvx.exe`, and similar launchers).
When a record also has a binary for the current platform, missing npx/uvx falls back to the
managed binary installer. Package-only records explain how to install Node.js/npm or uv and
are not persisted until their runner is available.
Run `harness find` without a query to browse the full catalog; users do not need to know an
agent name in advance. Query text is only an optional filter, and every unconfigured CLI result
prints the corresponding `martty harness add <id>` command.

### Harness TUI workflow

Run `/harness` inside Martty. The current item is pinned first and disabled; selecting another
configured item uses the normal switch flow. Choose **+ Add Harness…** to browse/search the Registry.
Press Delete on a saved, non-current item in the switch menu to remove configuration and optionally
exclusive private binaries. Escape returns from removal confirmation to removal mode, then to the
list, preserving selection. Use `/auth` for sign-in and `/status` to inspect runtime state.
Error panels show the reason and diagnostics directly; Enter retries.

In the TUI, choose **+ Add Harness** from `/harness` or run `/harness add` to open the
searchable catalog. Verified local npm/uv programs are reused where possible. Missing
dependencies offer installation guidance and recheck; Registry failures keep local choices.
Local discovery runs off the UI event loop alongside the Registry request. The picker
fills progressively, keeping search and selection, with non-selectable dividers for
`Installed / configured` and `Not downloaded`. A saved recipe is not proof that its
package has already been downloaded. Binary transfers time out only on connection
failure or lack of progress, not on total download duration.
Binary transfer uses `node-downloader-helper` in the existing Node.js client;
no separate downloader executable is required. Failed transfers can be retried
from the panel; partial downloads are cleaned up, not resumed across restarts.
npx/uvx preparation and binary downloads run in a progress panel. Enter keeps unfinished
downloads open; Escape hides the panel and continues in the background while Martty stays
open. Completion/failure is announced in the composer. Installation automatically saves
configuration; Enter on completion uses the normal `/harness` switch flow, while Escape only
closes the panel and Enter retries failures. Add/Install/Connect do not automatically switch or
authenticate. Press Enter on completion or select the configured Harness from `/harness`
to switch. Quitting stops unfinished jobs.
Installer output is captured, never written over the terminal. A switch updates
the default only after ACP `initialize` and `session/new` succeed, with retry on failure.

From a source checkout, `node scripts/harness-discovery-scenario.mjs --check` creates
and probes six isolated discovery states. Use `--tui` to open them in the local Martty
binary, then `/harness add`. The fixture uses a private temporary directory and fake
ACP replies; no real model, package download, or user Harness settings are used.

The same registry is available through three entry points: edit
`$MARTTY_HOME/settings.json`, use `martty harness`, or run `/harness` (or
`/harness <id>`) inside the TUI. In a standalone TUI, `/harness` immediately
switches before the current session has started. After the first prompt has
started a session, or an existing session was loaded, it first confirms that
the selected Harness will start another session; the current session remains
available in `/session`. Confirming stops the current ACP child and initializes
the selected Harness without closing Martty, then immediately sends `session/new`
to bind an empty session. This does not start a model turn. It never carries one session
across Harnesses. The settings and CLI entry points select the Harness for the
next standalone launch; a profile-owned Host cannot be replaced by its Client.

Every selection is stored in `$MARTTY_HOME/settings.json` as `defaultHarness`. CLI/settings
selection takes effect on the next standalone launch; TUI selection also
updates the running standalone process immediately. Standalone startup only
initializes the selected Harness and binds an empty ACP session before showing Ready.
The product's internal `forcedHarness` initialization value is empty by
default and is not a CLI/user startup argument. When the product supplies it,
startup selects it before consulting the persisted `defaultHarness`; when
empty, startup uses that saved default and otherwise the bundled fallback.
`/harness` updates the saved `defaultHarness`, never the product forced value.
`--agent` and `DSH_TUI_AGENT` remain higher startup priorities.
None of these replace the Host-owned runtime or session of
`dsh --profile martty`.

The Node Client process owns a Cordis tree and starts the Rust painter. A sibling
`tui-cordis-client-runner` publishes TUI Client capabilities and evaluates
approved `code.client` packages from `dsh-tool-cordis` against that client tree.

ACP is a runtime dependency of this package. On a profile that already carries
a different version through the standard ACP bundle, the package manager may
retain both copies, but the TUI bundle replaces that surface's rows and mounts
only the plugin resolved from TUI's own dependency graph. The supported profile
shape never runs two ACP surfaces for one TUI.

The package carries ACP as a runtime dependency and exports its Creator Host
overlay internally. The profile bundle mounts both on the Host Base tree;
neither enters the Client tree. Creator adds TUI plugin guidance to the
existing `cordis` preset and does not use ACP for skill registration.
Creator-authored UI Presets and Theme Plugins preview as process-local dynamic
Packages, then persist explicitly under `$MARTTY_HOME/plugins` through
`tui_plugin_save`; `tui_plugin_read` resumes authoring after restart.

`MARTTY_HOME` resolves explicitly first, then to `$DSH_HOME/.martty`, then to
`~/.martty`. UI choices live in `$MARTTY_HOME/settings.json`. On first use,
legacy Creator artifacts and settings are copied forward without deleting or
overwriting the old files.

Third-party TUI plugins remain ordinary installed packages. Their Host-side
registrar contributes an absolute Client module entry to `tuiClientPlugins`;
the Host runner serializes only that directory into the separate Client
process. Package entries and Creator artifacts share one Client lifecycle
manager, with installed packages winning same-id conflicts.

Node and Rust use inherited pipes on Unix and an authenticated loopback TCP
socket on Windows. This compositor channel carries theme/render data only;
agent traffic remains ACP.

## Demo

```sh
martty --demo
martty --demo-skin
```

Without a global installation:

```sh
npx --yes martty --demo
```

The profile path remains recommended for an existing DSH installation that
wants standard plugin management and a durable `martty` profile. `martty` is the
primary command; `dsh-tui` remains a compatibility alias.

## Highlights

- Streamed reasoning, replies, tool activity, subagents, run state, and
  token/cache metrics in one terminal timeline.
- Agent-advertised models, compositions, permissions, authentication methods,
  and invocable skills in one searchable slash menu.
- Up to eight editable image chips per prompt, with clipboard/file staging and
  metadata previews on kitty-capable terminals.
- Terminal-aware Markdown for headings, lists, quotes, code, emphasis, links,
  and mixed CJK/Latin text.
- Durable sessions, queued follow-ups, immediate steering, readline editing,
  platform-native modifier bindings, mouse selection, and inline-expanded tools.
- Dark/light themes, clipboard routing for local, tmux, and SSH sessions, plus
  the optional `/liang` pixel companion.
- Persistent UI Presets selected with the native `/ui` picker (or `/ui <id>`): builtin Martty and the classic
  DeepSeek Harness composition, both assembled from independent welcome Hero
  and information slots without writing to the transcript.
- A root `chrome.right` plugin rail for validated TuiNode trees, with live
  update/unload and Client inspect support for Creator-authored plugins.
- Lifecycle-owned local commands and native slider overlays, plus transactions
  over the current Session's standard ACP `configOptions`.
- Dynamic `code.host` + `code.client` Packages with inspect/run lifecycle and
  package-private Host/Client RPC over a negotiated `_dsh/cordis/*` ACP
  extension. Ordinary ACP agents remain usable when they do not advertise it.

## Plugin surface

TUI extensions are ordinary Cordis plugins on the Node Client tree. A single
plugin may register a theme, `chrome.right` nodes, slash commands, overlays,
timers, Session config transactions, and Host/Client RPC; all contributions
leave together when its fiber stops or `/theme` replaces the selected Theme
Plugin. Plugins submit semantic data and never receive the TTY, Ratatui,
absolute coordinates, compositor fds, or private transport methods.

The versioned contract and examples live in the repository's
[plugin API](https://github.com/openma-ai/Martty/blob/main/docs/plugins.en.md).

The demo needs no API key or agent. Run `martty --help` for agent, model,
credential, session, theme, and demo options.

## Supported platforms

| Node platform key | Binary |
|---|---|
| `darwin-arm64` | `vendor/darwin-arm64/martty` |
